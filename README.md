# ml_from_scratch
Attempt to implement ML Algorithms from scratch.
Currently planning to have sections as below :
1. Statistics and Probability
2. Linear Algebra and ML-utils
3. ML - Supervised and Unsupervised (separate sections)
4. Deep Learning
5. NLP

The plan is to complete around 100-150 implementations in a notebook in a simple to understandable fashion.
